TODO
 * missing config should raise error
 - pods should be in namespaces
 * add a key in modal popup?
 * zone / node / pod / container state
 * flexbox - stretch header column
 * foldable 'details' pane
 * new window 'details' pane
 * colour scheme
 * layout
 * dockerize
 * detect project / cluster
 * multiple node pools?
 * nodes and pod names - strip/hide uids
 * related pods - colour code a dot (based on metadata?)
 * display
   * services
     * load balancers
 * clicking on stuff takes you to k8s ui / logs, etc?

use cases:
 * share information (via urls)
 * display state (needs display state and filtering)
 * compare side-by-side data (requires some way to compare metadata (metadata window?))
 * show relations between resource types (relies on filtering and having more types (ingress/service/deployments))

queries should be copyable once on a page (base64 enc. short link) then processed as params to K8sMap component to allow re-visiting

toggleable filters:
 * view/hide deployments
 * view/hide ingresses
 * view/hide services

 * view/hide nodes (all)
 * view/hide pods (partial)
 * view/hide containers (partial)

 * view/hide container metadata
 * view/hide pod metadata
 * view/hide node metadata

filters:
 * filter by namespace (default to All)
 * filter by node
 * filter by app
 * filter by state

each component should have individually toggleable metadata
each component should have coloured dot to display state
